				<h1>Why Does the Buckeye Career Center Foundation Exist?</h1>
				<p>The Buckeye Career Center Foundation was created in 1999 by several area businessmen who wanted to form an endowment fund to award scholarships and grants to deserving Buckeye Career Center graduates. These scholarships and grants can be used by the students to further their education or purchase the tools required for their chosen trade.</p>
				<h2>Foundation Purpose</h2>
				<p>We believe vocational education is an essential part of the overall educational system and must be both encouraged and recognized. Graduates of the Buckeye Career Center enter a wide range of careers directly after school, or follow a path to further education and training. They go on to play important roles at many of our local employers in Tuscarawas County, ranging from healthcare, hospitality and food service to manufacturing, natural resources, utilities, building trades and transportation.</p>
				<p>We encourage you to learn more about Buckeye Career Center's programs and the supporting efforts of the Buckeye Career Center Foundation, and <a href="/donate-to-buckeye-career-center-foundation.php">consider contributing to our scholarship program</a>.</p>
