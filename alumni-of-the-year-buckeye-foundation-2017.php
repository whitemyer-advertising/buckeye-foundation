					<h2>Scott Rufener</h2>
				</div>
				<p>Scott Rufener is a 2009 Graduate of the Welding program at Buckeye Career Center.  He began at Eleet Cryogenics in 2008 as part of the Buckeye Work Placement Program.  During his time in the program, he honed his skills in multiple welding processes as well as learned the basics of cryogenic bulk tank rehabilitation.  Following high school, Scott was hired full-time at Eleet.  He began his career in the cryogenic industry stripping tanks of old components in preparation for more experienced technicians to rehabilitate.  In addition to receiving his welding certification, Scott also became certified in silver brazing, a crucial skill in both the rehabilitation process and the production of cryogenic control manifolds; the other half of Eleet's core business. Over the past few years, Scott distinguished himself as the top piper in the company combining speed and efficiency with quality craftsmanship.  He worked closely with the company president in designing the piping layout of a new product line launched in 2015 that has seen great success.  He is currently working on mastering the most difficult storage system in the cryogenic industry, liquid hydrogen.  His manager says, "I have no doubt that Scott will take on this challenge with the same drive and pride that we have witnessed from him over the years."  He is a leader in both performance and character and Eleet is proud to have him as a member of the team.  Scott currently lives in New Philadelphia with his wife Lindsey.</p>
